This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("explicitFunctions.R")
```

All data files are saved as csv files in the data directory. There are indiual files for each task and each group.

# Learning Curves

## Import adaptation data
Median reach angles per trial, per participant.

```{r}
# adaptationDF <- LoadReachData()
```

***

# Reach After Effects

## Import aftereffects data
Median angular deviation of the hand from target direction of each participant during open-loop reaches.
afterEffectsDF contains __baseline-corrected__ aftereffects recorded during the 'Rotated' session.
withoutStratAEDF contains aftereffects recorded during both sessions when participants do not employ a concious strategy, __with no baseline corrections__.

```{r}
afterEffectsDF <- LoadAEData()
withoutStratAEDF <- LoadAEData_NoBLCorr()
```

## Analysis of variance

First, we confirm that adaptation led to after effects. When we compare open-loop reaches where participants don't conciously employ a strategy, they should perform differently in the 'Rotated' session when compared to the 'Aligned' session.

__Note: we are just interested in the main effect of session. Should this even include instruction and rotation size?__

```{r warning=FALSE}
sessionAEAOV <- ezANOVA(data=withoutStratAEDF, dv=reachAE, wid=participant, 
                         within=.(session), between=.(instruction, rotationSize), 
                         return_aov=TRUE, type=3)
sessionAEAOV$ANOVA$p <-format(round(sessionAEAOV$ANOVA$p, 3), nsmall = 2)
sessionAEAOV$ANOVA$F <-format(round(sessionAEAOV$ANOVA$F, 4), nsmall = 2)
print(sessionAEAOV$ANOVA)
```

After confirming the presense of aftereffects, we test if instructions/rotation size brought about explicit learning.
We perform an ANOVA with rotation size and instruction type as between-subject factors, and strategy use (employing or not employing a strategy when reacing) as a within-subject factor.

```{r warning=FALSE}
aeANOVA <- ezANOVA(data=afterEffectsDF, dv=reachAE, wid=participant, 
                   within=stratUse, between=.(instruction, rotationSize), 
                   return_aov=TRUE, type=3)
aeANOVA$ANOVA$p <-format(round(aeANOVA$ANOVA$p, 3), nsmall = 2)

print(aeANOVA$ANOVA)
```
